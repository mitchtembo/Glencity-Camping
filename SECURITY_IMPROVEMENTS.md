# Security Improvement Summary: JWT Token Storage

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: JWT tokens were stored in localStorage, making them vulnerable to XSS attacks.

## Solution Implemented
Implemented secure cookie-based authentication using httpOnly cookies.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`backend/`)

1. **Updated Auth Routes** (`routes/auth.js`):
   - Modified register and login endpoints to set httpOnly cookies instead of returning tokens
   - Added logout endpoint to clear cookies
   - Updated responses to include user data and success status

2. **Enhanced Auth Middleware** (`middleware/auth.js`):
   - Updated to read tokens from cookies (with header fallback for backward compatibility)
   - Uses `req.cookies.auth_token` as primary source

3. **Added Cookie Parser** (`server.js`):
   - Installed and configured `cookie-parser` middleware
   - Updated CORS settings to allow credentials
   - Set specific origin for CORS instead of wildcard

### Frontend Changes (`src/`)

1. **Created Auth Context** (`contexts/AuthContext.jsx`):
   - Centralized authentication state management
   - Configured axios to include credentials (cookies) in requests
   - Provides login, register, logout, and auth status checking

2. **Updated Components**:
   - **App.jsx**: Wrapped app with AuthProvider
   - **RegisterPage.jsx**: Uses auth context instead of localStorage
   - **LoginPage.jsx**: Uses auth context instead of localStorage
   - **Navbar.jsx**: Uses auth context for authentication state
   - **ChaletPage.jsx**: Uses auth context instead of localStorage
   - **Bookings.jsx**: Uses auth context and cookie-based requests
   - **BookingPage.jsx**: Uses auth context instead of localStorage

## Security Benefits

1. **XSS Protection**: httpOnly cookies cannot be accessed by JavaScript, preventing XSS attacks
2. **Automatic Cookie Management**: Browsers handle cookie sending automatically
3. **CSRF Protection**: SameSite=strict setting prevents cross-site request forgery
4. **Secure Transport**: Cookies marked as secure in production (HTTPS only)
5. **Centralized Auth Logic**: All authentication logic centralized in AuthContext

## Configuration Details

- **Cookie Name**: `auth_token`
- **Settings**: httpOnly, secure (production), sameSite: strict
- **Expiration**: 24 hours
- **Domain**: localhost (development)

## Testing
- All existing functionality preserved
- Authentication state properly managed
- Automatic token refresh on page reload
- Proper logout handling with cookie clearing

## Migration Notes
- No user action required - existing sessions will need to re-login
- Frontend automatically uses new cookie-based authentication
- Backend maintains backward compatibility with header-based auth
