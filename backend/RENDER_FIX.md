# Quick Fix for Render Deployment Error

## The Problem
Render is trying to run `npm install; npm run build` but your backend doesn't need a build step.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Update Your Render Service Settings

Go to your Render dashboard and update these settings:

1. **Service Settings** â†’ **Build & Deploy**
2. **Build Command**: Change from `npm install; npm run build` to just:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start Command**: Should be:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Root Directory

Make sure **Root Directory** is set to:
```
backend
```

### Step 3: Redeploy

After making these changes, trigger a new deployment by:
- Pushing a new commit to your repository, OR
- Clicking "Manual Deploy" in the Render dashboard

## Why This Happened

Render auto-detected your project as a frontend project that needs building, but your backend is a Node.js server that doesn't require a build step - it runs directly with `node server.js`.

## Expected Result

After the fix, your logs should show:
```
==> Running build command 'npm install'...
added 159 packages, and audited 159 packages in 3s
found 0 vulnerabilities
==> Build succeeded ðŸŽ‰
==> Starting service with 'npm start'...
Server is running on port: 10000
MongoDB database connection established successfully
Environment: production
```

## If You Still Have Issues

1. Check that `backend` is set as the Root Directory
2. Verify your environment variables are set correctly
3. Check the MongoDB connection string is valid
4. Look for any missing environment variables in the logs
